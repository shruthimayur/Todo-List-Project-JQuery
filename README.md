# Todo-List-Project-JQuery
This is a simple project that uses HTML, CSS and JQuery to design and develop a web page that lets us make a list of todos, once they are done we could strike them off or delete them. This project demonstrates the computational capabilities of JQuery and how we can achieve amazing effects with minimal code.
